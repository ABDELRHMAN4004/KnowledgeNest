
## Introduction
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, learning, problem-solving, understanding natural language, recognizing patterns, and decision-making.

Unlike traditional programming, where explicit instructions are provided for every task, AI systems are designed to **learn from data** and **adapt their behavior** over time. This makes AI powerful in handling complex problems and automating tasks across various domains.

In this presentation, we will explore:
- The **history** and evolution of AI.
- The **different types** and **branches** of AI.
- Practical **applications**, as well as **benefits and challenges**.
- The **future trends** shaping AI technologies.
